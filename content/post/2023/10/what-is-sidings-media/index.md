So, what is Sidings Media? In short, it is an excuse to make cool stuff
and explore technology. The long answer begins somewhere in 2019 with 2
YouTube channels and absolutely no experience in making videos, let
alone ones people would want to watch. The idea was simple, create
tutorials for people wanting to explore technology. Safe to say, they
never really got off the starting blocks and only a few videos were ever
published.

Then COVID hit, the entire of the UK went into lockdown and suddenly I
had a lot of time on my hands. Of course, the only logical solution to
handle this sudden excess of time was to buy an old server and start
experimenting. I had already had some experience setting up servers with
the humble Raspberry Pi but it was time for something bigger.

Now, these things never stop at one do they. Soon I had taken over the
garage with a rack full of routers, switches and of course, more
servers; all of which were bought and operated using Sidings Media as
the justification.

That just about takes us to the present, a large and complicated home
network (that never ceases to annoy the rest of the family) that has
taught me more than anything else. Now, as far as I'm concerned, there
is no point in just keeping all of this knowledge to myself. I have read
countless articles, tutorials and posts whilst experimenting with the
network, so it is only right that I give a little bit back.

Up until this point, Sidings Media had been little more than a domain
name with a little website attached, the majority of the services being
internal to the network. With the idea of sharing knowledge in mind, it
was time to bring Sidings Media back to its origins as a platform to
explore technology and share knowledge, although this time not through
poorly edited videos!

Hopefully that has provided some insight into what Sidings Media
actually is and I hope you enjoy what's to come.
